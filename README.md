<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## :open_file_folder: About The Project



In the technological world we live in today, the gap between us and faith in God is growing increasingly distant. This is how Oraré was born, with the intention of bridging this gap by bringing light through the word of God directly into the palms of your hands, whenever and wherever you need it most.

This app will primarily have two functionalities:

**Bible Verse Recommender:**
A recommender of Bible verses based on the emotions/feelings conveyed by the users words. It will also take into account external factors and individual characteristics.

**Christian Event Recommender to Create/Form a Christian Community:**
By utilizing information from the community—churches, priests, catechists, and users—we can recommend various events happening in churches depending on the environment and location.
